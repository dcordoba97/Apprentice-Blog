									<h1>Week 4<br />
										It's all about science</h1>
									<p>
										This week wasn’t as rough as last week’s assignments, 
										making me save energy for the next month. Pretotypes, 
										this week’s homework, caught me off-guard since I 
										wasn’t really sure about what I was proposing at the 
										moment but I got through it with some cool ideas out 
										of just driving in the streets. 
									</p>

									Having to think about new stuff is a hard task when you are 
									living in the technological era where almost everything has 
									been worked on already. I was struggling with getting a good 
									idea, I don’t usually like to go with the first idea, since 
									I see it as if it is just a getaway to finish the homework. 
									Later in the weekend, I was driving back home and out of 
									nowhere in a streetlight, the idea just came to my mind. 
									Hyped, I rushed to my house and started typing everything I 
									needed to finish the pretotype. It is funny how sometimes 
									the ideas just come to my head and I am glad to thank 
									Barbara Oakley from Learning how to Learn for making me 
									realize it is just me hoping back and forward to the focus 
									and diffuse mode.  
								</p>
								<p>
									This was my last week on Learning how to learn, I will 
									talk about it more deeply in my monthly essay but yeah 
									as I said before, Barbara Oakley has got me learning more 
									about myself and how everything actually works. 
									Going through the focus/diffuse modes has made me 
									achieve a lot of work and this week was no exception. 
								</p>
								
								<p>
									Last week’s assignment had me struggling with a lot of new 
									concepts, I didn’t understand and one of them was Recursion. 
									I took the challenge of having my lightning talk out of that 
									topic and now I can say that Recursion is a concept I can 
									and will use in my future projects. I came to understand 
									that it was not something new to me but the concept itself 
									was. 
								</p>

								<p>
									New concepts, new ideas and new ways to achieve my goals have 
									been worked on this week and I feel like my development through 
									this program has been exponentially positive. Having people 
									leave the program every week has been tough since I could see 
									them giving their best every single minute they were here. All 
									I can do is take on the courage to carry their memories through 
									this program and finish it the best way I can.
