									<h1>Week 3<br />
										Polyglot Programming</h1>
									<p>
										Hello everyone and welcome to this weekly essay 
										update in which I talk about my doings, learnings, 
										thoughts and headaches throughout the week.
									</p>

								</header>
								<p>
									This week’s homework consisted of having to assemble all 
									the apprentice group into a single mind to work out every 
									problem we had to deliver by this past Monday. We had to 
									send a total of 20 pull requests into our company’s 
									repository for them to check the problems and see if we 
									did a good job. 
								</p>
								<p>
									The real issue started at the beginning where we had to 
									gather everyone to work as a whole and distribute in a 
									fair way who and in which language someone was going to 
									do. At the end of the day, we worked it out and everyone 
									had to do a certain challenge. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Hopping into the challenges, there were a few that had 
									its touch of difficulty and only a few of us could handle 
									that. Even though we spent the whole week and weekend 
									trying to solve them we could only achieve 99% of the 
									work that had to be done. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Having to rely on many people to work on a lot of stuff 
									is hard. There’s nothing that will make sure that they 
									will do what they have got to do, but it is a matter of 
									trust and responsibility for them and us to deliver the 
									homework. I’m feeling kind of worried about the work we 
									delivered since it is not “complete”, I really hope we 
									can mend this by completing the homework at least by the 
									next day of the next week’s assignment. 
								</p>
