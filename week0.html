									<h1>Week 0<br />
									Introduction</h1>
									<p> In this document the user will be able to catch up and understand everything an Apprentice2022a
										 member did in the Introduction week. Talking from the very first topic ¨Apprentice Program 2022a¨
										  to the last ¨Daily TIL¨. Every topic is key for the upcoming weeks so listen carefully. </p>
								</header>
								<p>The week started off; the first session was mostly about how's the Apprentice program going to be.
									 A little heads up about account settings and tips to communicate with other offices/teams 
									 for corresponding needs. Quick explanation of how Daily stand ups works and a demonstration of it. 
									 By turns, everyone has to say what they did the day before that and what they are up to today and 
									 if they had any blockers (anything that is holding you from progressing to the goal). 
									 Following that same day, the TIL session started with a tutorial of what's that about. 
									 We ran a quick demo and went through it just right I believe. It works similar to the Daily Stand ups. 
									 By turns, you got to say how you feel today and if you learn something. 
									 You end the turn by giving kudos to someone (a kudo is given when you reckon someone for 
									 aiding you somehow)
								</p>
								<p>
									Aside from the daily stand ups and TIL sessions, 
									homework was very intuitive and rewarding. /NDA/ 
									compliance courses, Day-to-Day with /NDA/ devs and A Future Vision of Myself were so enriching for me, 
									there's a lot of aspects that you got to consider that you might not have. 
									Talking to the devs made me really understand how a future vision of myself would be. 
									Every point of view is different but the fact that they all told me about their day in such an amazing way 
									gave me goosebumps about becoming a developer.
								</p>

								<p>
									I assisted to /NDA/, a community 
									related meeting that /NDA/ arrange. 
									There's a lot of stuff everyone has to say and talk about 
									that can help you in some way. Met a few amazing people that 
									cheered me and talked to me about their passions and what they 
									love about being a dev and an /NDA/! Later in the week, 
									/NDA/ from /NDA/ presented a workshop called 
									/SUPER NDA/ in which we talked about how to make 
									every person we talk to feel comfortable with us and feel like 
									they are connecting with us rather than just talking or doing business. 
									We also had an English session called /NDA IN ENGLISH/ 
									by /NDA/ and /NDA/, I think that there's always opportunity to 
									grow in every skill we have. Communicating with the clients 
									is crucial and shouldn't be a rock on the road. 
								</p>

								<p>
									As Week 0: Introduction concludes, the desire to push 
									myself to new things has risen. Every single topic/session 
									felt organic and precise with what I needed to learn to be 
									prepared for the upcoming days. Next week will be the start 
									of The Apprentice Program 2022a and I should already 
									have all my accounts/tools ready to start.
