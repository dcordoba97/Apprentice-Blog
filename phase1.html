									<h1>Phase 1<br />
										RESET</h1>
									<p>
										A rollercoaster of emotions is the best way to describe this month. 
										Never in my entire life have I felt like I, as a human and as a 
										developer, have learned so much stuff every single day going through 
										how to have a conversation, how to take feedback, how to work as a 
										team and how to work as well. 
									</p>

								</header>
								<p>
									New concepts are part of a new beginning. Starting from day one, my mind 
									was blown with this much information being placed in my hands and the way 
									they all pictured how we were going to do all this stuff made my motivation 
									go across the sky. Every single day of this month I tried to share with my 
									coworkers/friends this joy and hype I was feeling so they could feel the 
									same if needed. Having so many people leave the program after we made a 
									bond really made me sad but at the end of the day, the doors are still open 
									for most of them which makes me have hope to work with them in the near future. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Having almost zero knowledge about programming and going through the said 
									week in which we had to complete some challenges in different programming 
									languages really shaped me in a good way. Pushing myself to the limits, 
									having my girlfriend cheer me up, my friends/coworkers help me understand 
									stuff I was a foreign to and the staff/program making me learn beforehand 
									more stuff every day is what made me go through this week. Not the coffee 
									(maybe yes), not the late nights of working, but the whole process of the 
									program with people willing to help and work with each other. 
								</p>
								
								<p>
									This month we had to do this course called “Learning how to Learn” 
									by Barbara Oakley. I’m positive to say that there is just so much stuff 
									I wasn’t aware of but still did every day and now that I’m aware it feels 
									as if I now have a good grip when I'm trying to understand new stuff. 
									Thanks Barbara Oakley! 
								</p>

								<p>
									I want to thank everyone who has been part of this batch (coworkers/staff/mentors) 
									for leading me in such a good way by giving me feedback and helping me understand 
									concepts that I struggled with. Having this kind of attention really cheers me up 
									and makes me give my 120%. Will see you guys in the next monthly essay to see how 
									much I've learned.  c:
