									<h1>Week 1<br />
									Innovation & Hard/Smart work</h1>
									<p>
										This week has a focus on self-recognition and how I can change my bad 
										habits and reroute them into good habits. From tools to tips, in this 
										essay I'll make you catch up on what and how I learned more about 
										myself and how to improve as a person, coworker and friend. 
									</p>

								<p>
									Starting off with how often, when I’m having a conversation, 
									it is easy to make the other person feel like I'm not really 
									paying attention because of the bad habits I have while talking 
									to them. I also will never forget the autopilot lesson since 
									it described me almost perfectly and since then, the autopilot 
									withing myself will never rise under my watch. Personal transcendence 
									can be a mystery or a way of life. People tend to limit 
									themselves to their own comfort zone and what pushes us out 
									of it is actually our self interest in transcend. But what
									really makes us feel that way? I believe that every person 
									has to make an everyday decision, will I do what I want or will 
									I do what I “have” to do? And here is where Creative 
									thinking may come in. As the past two questions make us 
									create our path, we can also spice things up and make every 
									“bad path” a better path. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Making up your mind to do something in particular is not 
									just walking into it and “getting it done”. Working smart 
									to achieve something can create an easier path and eventually 
									make the walk effortless. What I mean by this is: I don’t 
									believe there’s a clear path to anything in particular, 
									even the sky has clouds. The cool part about this is that 
									we know that after the clouds, we find the stars that we 
									look up to everyday. In this journey of looking for one's 
									true purpose, failure is imminent but the main idea of 
									rising up again after every lost battle is to transcend. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Throughout the week, mistakes were made and lessons were 
									learned. The one that stands the most is: Negotiating. 
									I believe that when people unite to achieve the same 
									goal is when the impossible happens and this is no exception. 
									We learned that we have to have a group talk before taking 
									decisions because there may be something we are missing and 
									someone else can spot it and let us know so we as a 
									community/group/team make a common agreement and talk it through.
