									<h1>Week 2<br />
									Fancy Topics</h1>
									<p>
										This week was definitely a challenge for me since I went 
										through a lot of concepts that I didn’t know or at least 
										didn’t understand until now. Object-Oriented programming 
										was key for this week’s homework but methods were also 
										required to be used in order to accomplish what was assigned. 
									</p>

								<p>
									Object-Oriented programming, as said before, was key to 
									getting things done through this week. I’ve learned a 
									lot about certain tools Java has and how IntelliJ is pretty 
									cool to code in when you are using Java. Installing API’s and 
									plugins for my pom was not much of a challenge since I thought 
									it was something with my laptop but at the end of the day, 
									I think it was part of the assignment. As for the assignment, 
									we had to develop a class for this test in which we get through 
									some arrays to arrange data from a movies.txt (In which you 
									could see it was a big data txt of movie reviews) and then 
									process it so it prints some recommendations for a certain user. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I don’t think I've been more active in a single problem than 
									this time. My brain feels heavy and dry and I could use some sleep. 
									Navigating through the assignment, I realized that I had to use 
									hashes instead of just a regular Array because I had to have this 
									certain key and this certain value. So, I opted to use Hash Sets 
									because I had to have no repeated UserIds and HashSet property 
									makes it so keys are not repeated. Then I've got to realize that 
									I actually had to use a HashMap in both ways so I could call the 
									buffer writer to write in my .csv or at least that’s how I 
									pictured it. So far, I had all my tests going through successfully 
									but the last test of the recommendations part was wrong. My .csv was 
									giving me null values for a certain key and that made me focus on my 
									logic statements. After some hard work and focus I got to see that 
									my problem was in how I used my buffer writer... I was using it in 
									the wrong order in which my .csv had to be filed so I just grabbed 
									the pieces that my buffer writer was going to write and then called 
									it in a function so it makes sure that it is in the right order. 
								</p>

								<p>
									I think that if I knew beforehand about Hash’s, IntelliJ, Java 
									and how to google my doubts, my assignment would’ve been done by 
									Thursday. This kind of project will make sure you either learn or 
									fail and I'm happy to say that I learned a lot of concepts that only 
									by trial-and-error you learn.
